# Game mechanics
* wind
* ability to grab and release a weight
* ability to grab platforms/sides of walls, even ceilings?
* multiple webs at once
* moving platforms
* enemies: birds?
* power-ups: flies
* have web wrap around blocks (could be hard to achieve)
* world bounds?
* controls revamp: aiming as primary 'state', walking as secondary. Maybe up/down controls state so down is crawling (moving) and up is 'standing' (aiming).
* picking up objects to gain mass (affects walking speed), dropping objects mid-swing for awesome spring mechanics
